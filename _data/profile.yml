   Bonjour Hi! I am a first-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at McGill University. I was fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=8vXnOQsAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank"> Prof. Mathieu Blanchette</a>. 
   Before that, I obtained my Master's degree in the same department and obtained my bachelor's degree at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2022.
  </p>
  <p>
  My research interest spans from artificial intelligence and computational biology. 
  </p>
