   Bonjour Hi! I am a first-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at <a href=" https://www.mcgill.ca/" target="_blank"> McGill University </a> 
   and <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/directory/yijie-zhang" target="_blank"> MILA - Québec AI Institute </a>, advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=8vXnOQsAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank"> Prof. Mathieu Blanchette</a>. 
   Prior to this, I obtained my Master's degree from the same department in August 2024.
  </p>
  <p>
  My research interests lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence and computational biology. Currently, I am focused on developing accurate 
  and lightweight encoders to enhance the understanding of structure-function relationships in various biomolecules.
  </p>

  <p>
  Aussi, je suis en train d'apprendre le français :)
  </p>
