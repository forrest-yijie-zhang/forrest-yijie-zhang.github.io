abstract: >-
  Protein inverse folding has gained attention recently, but existing methods are limited by the CATH dataset, recovery metric, and lack of a unified benchmarking framework. To address this, we propose ProteinBench, a comprehensive benchmark integrating diverse protein design tasks, models, and evaluation metrics, enabling thorough comparisons and inspiring future advancements.
