 Predicting protein stability changes from single-point mutations remains a significant challenge, hindered by feature extraction complexity and limited experimental data. Leveraging ESM-based large language models, we propose an efficient method integrating sequence and structural features to predict thermostability changes, supported by a carefully curated dataset to ensure fair model comparison.
