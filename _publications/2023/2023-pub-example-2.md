  Recent studies in protein design achieve competitive performance but often overlook predictive confidence, broad protein space coverage, and common protein knowledge. To address this, we propose KW-Design, a method that refines low-quality residues using a knowledge-aware module and accelerates training with a memory-retrieval mechanism
