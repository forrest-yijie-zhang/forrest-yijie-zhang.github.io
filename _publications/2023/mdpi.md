  Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) addresses growing demands for high-quality computing, but traditional resource allocation faces challenges like privacy risks, further complicated by blockchain-enabled MEC systems. To tackle this, we propose a blockchain-based MEC architecture with a novel Proof of Learning (PoL) consensus, optimizing resource allocation using an A3C algorithm enhanced with temporal convolutional networks (TCN) for faster, more stable convergence.
